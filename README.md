Smart Glasses for the Visually Impaired: "Third Eye for Blind Person"

Project Overview
This project aims to develop a wearable smart device—smart glasses—that assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings. The "Third Eye for Blind Person" device uses ultrasonic technology to detect obstacles and provide real-time feedback through auditory and haptic signals. The device aims to offer increased independence and mobility for blind individuals, allowing them to move more confidently and safely through both familiar and unfamiliar environments.

Key Features:
Obstacle Detection: The ultrasonic sensor continuously scans the environment to detect obstacles in the user’s path.
Real-Time Feedback: When an obstacle is detected, the device alerts the user through both a buzzer (auditory feedback) and a vibrating motor (haptic feedback).
Wearable Design: The system is integrated into a pair of glasses for hands-free use, ensuring ease of wear and social acceptance.
How It Works:
Obstacle Detection: The ultrasonic sensor measures distances between the user and objects in their environment.
Feedback Mechanism: When an object is within a predefined threshold, the system triggers the buzzer and vibrating motor to alert the user. The closer the object, the more intense the feedback.
Microcontroller Integration: The Arduino Nano microcontroller processes data from the ultrasonic sensor and activates the feedback mechanism accordingly.

Scalability:
Integration with Advanced Sensors and Devices: Future versions can incorporate additional sensors (e.g., LiDAR) and integrate with smartphones or other wearables, enhancing navigation and providing more comprehensive assistive features.
